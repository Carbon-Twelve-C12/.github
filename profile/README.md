Harnessing the power of the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/) and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) to forge a more sustainable future.

Right now, we're working on two projects: 

 - [Supernova](https://github.com/Carbon-Twelve-C12/supernova), a next-generation proof-of-work blockchain featuring quantum-resistant security throughout, including the first quantum-secure Lightning Network implementation. Built in Rust for maximum performance and safety, Supernova combines cutting-edge cryptography with comprehensive environmental tracking to create a truly sustainable future for blockchain technology.

- [Quantera](https://quantera.finance/), a platform for tokenizing any financial product. The platform is architecturally designed for multi-asset support with superior liquidity solutions, yield optimization, and cross-chain interoperability. Quantera aims to become the leading tokenization platform globally, serving both institutional and individual investors.
